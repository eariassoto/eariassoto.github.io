      <description>Ever since the C++ language was first standardized, new and delete were defined as the methods to create/delete objects dynamically. The new operator allocates a memory block to construct an object and then calls the proper class&amp;rsquo; constructor to initialize it. If successful, this operator will return a pointer to the location of the memory block. Otherwise, it will return nullptr or it will throw an exception. The delete operator executes the inverse operation, it deallocates object&amp;rsquo;s memory block.</description>
